\chapter{Requirements Traceability\label{ref-032}}

[This paragraph shall contain:

\begin{itemize}
\item Traceability from each software item requirement in this specification to the system (or subsystem, if applicable) requirements it addresses. (Alternatively, this traceability may be provided by annotating each requirement in Section 3).

Note: Each level of system refinement may result in requirements not directly traceable to higher-level requirements. For example, a system architectural design that creates multiple software/hardware items may result in requirements about how the software/hardware items will interface, even though these interfaces are not covered in system requirements. Such requirements may be traced to a general requirement such as ``system implementation'' or to the system design decisions that resulted in their generation.

\item Traceability from each system (or subsystem, if applicable) requirement allocated to this software item to the software item requirements that address it. All system (subsystem) requirements allocated to this software item shall be accounted for. Those that trace to software item requirements contained in IRSs shall reference those IRSs.]

\end{itemize}
